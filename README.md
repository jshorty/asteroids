## About
Zen Petri dish borrows concepts from the Asteroids arcade game, but at a scale many orders of magnitude smaller. The player floats (or fights) to survive while surrounded by his slightly larger, albeit microscopic neighbors.

## Next Step Goals
- [X] Realistic bullet speed/direction (use player movement vectors)
- [X] Respawning enemies
- [ ] Player has limited lives, Game Over screen displayed when finished
- [ ] Switch to time-based scoring rather than by # enemies destroyed
- [ ] Germs split into two smaller ones when shot (currently they just shrink or disappear)
